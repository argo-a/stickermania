# StickerMania Core Principles and Best Practices

## Core Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### Independent Collectibles
- Albums, stickers, cards, packs, memorabilia and boxes as separate entities
- Each item can be collected independently
- Multiple editions and variations tracking
- Cross-item relationships through competitions

#### Company-Based Trading
- Centralized trading through company
- Inventory management and allocation

### 2. Clean Architecture

#### Domain Layer

#### Application Layer

#### Infrastructure Layer

### 3. SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility
- Each service handles one domain aspect
- Dedicated inventory management
- Focused endpoints

#### Open/Closed
- Extensible edition types
- Pluggable shipping providers
- Flexible completion rules
- Customizable trade calculations

#### Interface Segregation
- Specific interfaces for each collectible type
- Separate trading interfaces
- Dedicated inventory management
- Clear API boundaries

### 4. Database Design

#### Entity Relationships
```sql
-- Competition as root entity
-- Independent collectibles

#### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints
- Unique constraints

### 5. API Design

#### RESTful Endpoints
```python
@router.get("/collectors/{collector_id}/collection")
```

#### Trading Endpoints
```python
@router.post("/trades/request")
```

### 6. Business Logic

#### Collection Rules
```python
def validate_collection_rules(collector: Collector, item: Collectible):
    """
    Validate collection rules:
    1. Allow multiple editions
    2. Track duplicates separately
    3. Validate completion status
    4. Handle independent items
    """
    pass
```

#### Trading Rules
```python
def validate_trade_rules(trade: TradeRequest):
    """
    Validate trade rules:
    1. Check company inventory
    2. Calculate fair trade
    3. Verify shipping details
    4. Handle allocation
    """
    pass
```

### 7. Error Handling

```python
class CollectionError(Exception):
    """Base error for collection operations."""
    pass

class TradeError(Exception):
    """Base error for trading operations."""
    pass

def handle_collection_error(error: CollectionError):
    """Handle collection-specific errors."""
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=400,
        content={"error": str(error)}
    )
```

### 8. Testing Strategy

```python
class TestCollectionManagement:
    """Test collection management with editions."""
    def test_add_album_with_edition(self):
        collector = create_test_collector()
        album = create_test_album(edition="gold")
        result = collection_service.add_album(collector, album)
        assert result.edition == "gold"

class TestCompanyTrading:
    """Test company-based trading."""
    def test_create_trade_request(self):
        inventory = create_test_inventory()
        request = create_test_trade_request()
        result = trade_service.create_trade(request)
        assert result.status == TradeStatus.pending
```

### 10. Performance Optimization

```python
# Efficient queries for collections
@cached(ttl=300)
def get_collector_statistics(collector_id: int):
    """Get cached collector statistics."""
    pass

# Optimized inventory checks
def check_inventory_availability(items: List[Item]):
    """Efficient inventory checking with proper indexing."""
    pass
```

These principles guide the development of a soccer-focused collectibles platform that:
1. Centers around soccer competitions
2. Supports independent collection of items
3. Manages multiple editions and variations
4. Handles company-based trading
5. Maintains efficient inventory management
6. Provides comprehensive collection display

Follow these principles to ensure consistency, maintainability, and scalability throughout the implementation.
